# Purpose
This is the git repo for what used to be my personal website, previously hosted live on Heroku.  Overall, it serves as a great entry project for learning Ruby on Rails.

# What does it do?
This project contains user functionality (which only allows access for one user), personal project pages/descriptions, a blog, and static pages to learn more about me and contact me.

# Technology Used
This website is built using Ruby on Rails.
The Rails version is 5.0.
The Ruby version I'm using is 2.3
Postgresql is used as the database for this project.

# Can I Use/Modify/Study this?
Sure! Feel free to take a look at any of the code and play around with it, use it to make your own portolio site, etc.

# Installation and Running
Nothing special is needed to run the website, apart from normal rake commands.

1. `bundle exec rake db:create`

2. `bundle exec rake db:migrate`

3. `rails server`

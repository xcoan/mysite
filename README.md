# Purpose
This is the git repo for my personal website. It is hosted on heroku and live [here](http://www.xjcoan.com)

# Technology Used
This website is built using Ruby on Rails.
The Rails version is 5.0.
The Ruby version I'm using is 2.3

# Installation and Running
Nothing special is needed to run the website, apart from normal rake commands.
`bundle exec rake db:create`
`bundle exec rake db:migrate`
`rails server`
Should all do the trick.
